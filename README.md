# EchoMind · Whitepaper v0.1  
**“Where Knowledge Becomes Currency.”**

## 🌍 Vision
EchoMind is a decentralized, offline-accessible knowledge economy —  
a place where people who organize and share knowledge are rewarded,  
and where AI can learn from human insight even without the cloud.

> Knowledge is the new fuel for intelligence.  
> EchoMind lets it flow freely, transparently, and meaningfully.

## 🧠 Core Ideas
- **Offline AI (Local RAG):** Every piece of knowledge can power local AI.  
- **Knowledge Ownership:** All submissions are hashed and timestamped on-chain.  
- **Knowledge-to-Earn (K2E):** Contribute → Verify → Earn → Govern.  
- **DeFi Island:** Each topic community becomes an independent knowledge economy.
